# IAB workshop on the IP Geolocation File Distribution (GeoIP)

# Introduction

REPLACE THIS TEXT 

The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide IETF when working on network management protocols. The outcome of that workshop was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operator requirements for consideration in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with some recommendations for the IETF.

Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated YANG data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950], RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF [I-D.ietf-core-comi].

It has been more than 20 years since that IAB workshop, and it is time to evaluate what has been achieved since the original workshop and what recommendations and requirements have changed or still need to be addressed. This new workshop aims to discuss the following key topics:

Review the outcomes and results of the 2002 workshop (current deployments, state of the art) and identify any operational barriers that prevent these technologies from being widely implemented (limitations, hurdles).
Sketch new requirements for future network management operations in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators, and protocol engineers.
Develop a plan of action and recommendations for the IETF.

## In-Scope Topics
The following topics are considered in-scope; however, this list is non-exhaustive:

Actionable requirements for network management, including:
Troubleshooting needs
Metrics for network performance measurements
Requirements for security functions
Proposals or reports on improvements to network management
Ways to support evolving, encrypted traffic better
Measurement techniques for encrypted traffic
New privacy-preserving active measurement methods
Direct communication with endpoints or applications
Secure and privacy-preserving data collection, storage, and sharing
Adoption of encryption for the management functions themselves

# Pre-Workshop Information Gathering & Outreach

REPLACE THIS TEXT 

In 2002, many network operators attended IETF meetings and participated in network management protocol discussions. Direct IETF participation from network operators has since decreased, with many operators focusing on conferences that are more central to their needs (RIPE, NANOG, APRICOT, AutoConn, etc.).

Under this effort, we expect some workshop participants to stimulate an outreach effort to attract opinions and interest by visiting these other venues and running information and requirement-gathering sessions. This series of outreach efforts will result in workshop position papers that will provide valuable summarized feedback to the online NEMOPS Workshop.

The mailing list nemops-interest@iab.org will be used for outreach events at other conferences, general announcements, and related discussions before (and after) the workshop.

# Workshop

REPLACE/UPDATE THIS TEXT 

Interested participants in the workshop are invited to submit position papers on the workshop topics. There are no restrictions on the format. Participants can choose their preferred format, including Internet-Drafts, text- or word-based documents, or papers formatted similarly to academic publication venues. Submission as PDF is preferred. Paper size is not limited, but brevity is encouraged. Interested participants who have published relevant academic papers may submit these as a position paper, optionally with a short abstract explaining their interest and the paperâ€™s relevance to the workshop. The workshop itself will be focused on discussions based on the position paper topics received.

All inputs submitted and considered relevant will be published on the workshop website. The organizers will issue invitations based on the submissions received. Sessions will be organized according to content, and not every accepted submission or invited attendee will have an opportunity to present; the intent is to foster an active discussion and not simply to have a sequence of presentations. The workshop may also include breakout sessions. A workshop report covering all submissions and discussions will be published afterward.

The workshop will be by invitation only. Those wishing to attend should submit a "position paper" or "expressions of interest" to address the above topics and questions. Position papers from those not planning to participate in the workshop themselves are also encouraged.

Additionally, we request network operators to complete the survey to help us better understand current network management practices, challenges, and future needs. The survey responses will provide valuable input for the workshop - https://ietf.iad1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9vQxBRiZqDntarc .

The online workshop would likely be three 2-3h sessions spread over the week based on submissions and the availability of the invited participants.

## Logistics This workshop will be held online.
